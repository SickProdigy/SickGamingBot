Giveaway command and past commands used

You can only have like 50 characters when posting to giveaway bot. So name your giveaway, and post the description and all before posting the giveaway. so the last thing people see is the thumbs up to enter giveaway. (or first thing when it's the last thing posted). Easier for users to get entered and react to the appropriate message.
